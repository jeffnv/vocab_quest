	-done 1. during game modes, can keep track of words that were missed and keep cycling those back in until they are successfully matched
	-done 2. keeps a list (saves at exit) trouble words and frequently uses them in game until they are mastered
	-ehh..3. allows user to banish certain words that they know completely
	-done 4. user can select certain files to load or load them all for use in games
