===========

A simple GRE vocabulary test to help me practice ruby

basic requirements:
	1. can load lists of words and definition from at least one text file
	2. can display run at least one type of word - definition matching game
	3. displays a main menu

advanced requirements: (maybe implement someday...)
	1. during game modes, can keep track of words that were missed and keep cycling those back in until they are successfully matched
	2. keeps a list (saves at exit) trouble words and frequently uses them in game until they are mastered
	3. allows user to banish certain words that they know completely
	4. user can select certain files to load or load them all for use in games

Iteration 1 - Create main menu and word loading
	1. The 'game' should be able to load a list of words and definitions from a text file.
	2. The 'game' should present user with a list of game modes including 'q' to end the session.
	3. The 'game' should start the game mode selected by the user or quit if 'q' is entered

Iteration 2 - Create game mode
